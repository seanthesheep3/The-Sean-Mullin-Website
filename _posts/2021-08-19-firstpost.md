**Hello and welcome!** 

This is my first entry on my personal website/blog.

This site/blog is intended to serve multiple roles. Firstly, this is my first adventure into web development, so this site is mainly an educational experience. I'll be trying new stuff out, adding different types of content and development styles.  It will also likely be like a landing page for me, place to put fun articles, helpful links, and maybe a interesting life update every once in a while! 

Let's get started :)
